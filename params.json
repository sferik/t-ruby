To do this, you need to add my\r\npublic key as a trusted certificate (you only need to do this once):\r\n\r\n    gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/sferik/t/master/certs/sferik.pem)\r\n\r\nThen, install the gem with the high security trust policy:\r\n\r\n    gem install t -P HighSecurity\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nTwitter API v1.1 requires OAuth for all of its functionality, so you'll need a\r\nregistered Twitter application. If you've never registered a Twitter\r\napplication before, it's easy! Just sign-in using your Twitter account and the\r\nfill out the short form at <http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new>. If you've\r\npreviously registered a Twitter application, it should be listed at\r\n<http://dev.twitter.com/apps>. Once you've registered an application, make sure\r\nto set your application's Access Level to \"Read, Write and Access direct\r\nmessages\", otherwise you'll receive an error that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    Error processing your OAuth request: Read-only application cannot POST\r\n\r\nNow, you're ready to authorize a Twitter account with your application. To\r\nproceed, type the following command at the prompt and follow the instructions:\r\n\r\n    t authorize\r\n\r\nThis command will direct you to a URL where you can sign-in to Twitter,\r\nauthorize the application, and then enter the returned PIN back into the\r\nterminal. If you type the PIN correctly, you should now be authorized to use\r\n`t` as that user. To authorize multiple accounts, simply repeat the last step,\r\nsigning into Twitter as a different user.\r\n\r\nYou can see a list of all the accounts you've authorized by typing the command:\r\n\r\n    t accounts\r\n\r\nThe output of which will be structured like this:\r\n\r\n    sferik\r\n      UDfNTpOz5ZDG4a6w7dIWj\r\n      uuP7Xbl2mEfGMiDu1uIyFN\r\n    gem\r\n      thG9EfWoADtIr6NjbL9ON (active)\r\n\r\n**Note**: One of your authorized accounts (specifically, the last one\r\nauthorized) will be set as active. To change the active account, use the `set`\r\nsubcommand, passing either just a username, if it's unambiguous, or a username\r\nand consumer key pair, like this:\r\n\r\n    t set active sferik UDfNTpOz5ZDG4a6w7dIWj\r\n\r\nAccount information is stored in a YAML-formatted file located at `~/.trc`.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Anyone with access to this file can impersonate you on Twitter, so\r\nit's important to keep it secure, just as you would treat your SSH private key.\r\nFor this reason, the file is hidden and has the permission bits set to `0600`.\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\nTyping `t help` will list all the available commands. You can type `t help\r\nTASK` to get help for a specific command.\r\n\r\n    t help\r\n\r\n#### Update your status\r\n    t update \"I'm tweeting from the command line. Isn't that special?\"\r\n\r\n**Note**: If your tweet includes special characters (e.g. `!`), make sure to\r\nwrap it in single quotes instead of double quotes, so those characters are not\r\ninterpreted by your shell. (However, if you use single quotes, your Tweet\r\nobviously can't contain any apostrophes.)\r\n\r\n#### Retrieve detailed information about a Twitter user\r\n    t whois @sferik\r\n\r\n#### Retrieve stats for multiple users\r\n    t users -l @sferik @gem\r\n\r\n#### Follow users\r\n    t follow @sferik @gem\r\n\r\n#### Check whether one user follows another\r\n    t does_follow @ev @sferik\r\n\r\n**Note**: If the first user does not follow the second, `t` will exit with a\r\nnon-zero exit code. This allows you to execute commands conditionally, for\r\nexample, send a user a direct message only if he already follows you:\r\n\r\n    t does_follow @ev && t dm @ev \"What's up, bro?\"\r\n\r\n#### Create a list for everyone you're following\r\n    t list create following-`date \"+%Y-%m-%d\"`\r\n\r\n#### Add everyone you're following to that list (up to 500 users)\r\n    t followings | xargs t list add following-`date \"+%Y-%m-%d\"`\r\n\r\n#### List all the members of a list, in long format\r\n    t list members -l following-`date \"+%Y-%m-%d\"`\r\n\r\n#### List all your lists, in long format\r\n    t lists -l\r\n\r\n#### List all your friends, in long format, ordered by number of followers\r\n    t friends -l --sort=followers\r\n\r\n#### List all your leaders (people you follow who don't follow you back)\r\n    t leaders -l --sort=followers\r\n\r\n#### Unfollow everyone you follow who doesn't follow you back\r\n    t leaders | xargs t unfollow\r\n\r\n#### Unfollow 10 people who haven't tweeted in the longest time\r\n    t followings -l --sort=tweeted | head -10 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs t unfollow -i\r\n\r\n#### Twitter roulette: randomly follow someone who follows you (who you don't already follow)\r\n    t groupies | shuf | head -1 | xargs t follow\r\n\r\n#### Favorite the last 10 tweets that mention you\r\n    t mentions -n 10 -l | awk '{print $1}' | xargs t favorite\r\n\r\n#### Output the last 200 tweets in your timeline to a CSV file\r\n    t timeline -n 200 --csv > timeline.csv\r\n\r\n#### Start streaming your timeline (Control-C to stop)\r\n    t stream timeline\r\n\r\n#### Count the number of employees who work for Twitter\r\n    t list members twitter/team | wc -l\r\n\r\n#### Search Twitter for the 20 most recent Tweets that match a specified query\r\n    t search all \"query\"\r\n\r\n#### Download the latest Linux kernel via BitTorrent (possibly NSFW, depending where you work)\r\n    t search all \"lang:en filter:links linux torrent\" -n 1 | grep -o \"http://t.co/[0-9A-Za-z]*\" | xargs open\r\n\r\n#### Search Tweets you've favorited that match a specified query\r\n    t search favorites \"query\"\r\n\r\n#### Search Tweets mentioning you that match a specified query\r\n    t search mentions \"query\"\r\n\r\n#### Search Tweets you've retweeted that match a specified query\r\n    t search retweets \"query\"\r\n\r\n#### Search Tweets in your timeline that match a specified query\r\n    t search timeline \"query\"\r\n\r\n#### Search Tweets in another user's timeline that match a specified query\r\n    t search timeline @sferik \"query\"\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Deep search: Instead of using the Twitter Search API, [which only only goes\r\n  back 6-9 days][search], `t search` fetches up to 3,200 tweets via the REST API\r\n  and then checks each one against a regular expression.\r\n* Multi-threaded: Whenever possible, Twitter API requests are made in parallel,\r\n  resulting in faster performance for bulk operations.\r\n* Designed for Unix: Output is designed to be piped to other Unix utilities,\r\n  like grep, comm, cut, awk, bc, wc, and xargs for advanced text processing.\r\n* Generate spreadsheets: Convert the output of any command to CSV format simply\r\n  by adding the `--csv` flag.\r\n* 95% C0 Code Coverage: Well tested, with a 2.5:1 test-to-code ratio.\r\n\r\n[search]: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search\r\n\r\n## Using T for Backup\r\n[@jphpsf][jphpsf] wrote a [blog post][blog] explaining how to use `t` to backup\r\nyour Twitter account.\r\n\r\n[jphpsf]: https://github.com/jphpsf\r\n[blog]: http://blog.jphpsf.com/2012/05/07/backing-up-your-twitter-account-with-t/\r\n\r\n`t` was also mentioned on [an episode of the Ruby 5 podcast][ruby5].\r\n\r\n`t` was also discussed on [an episode of the Ruby Rogues podcast][rubyrogues].\r\n\r\n[ruby5]: http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/273-episode-269-may-4th-2012/stories/2400-t-command-line-power-tool-for-twitter\r\n\r\n[rubyrogues]: http://rubyrogues.com/127-rr-erik-michaels-ober/\r\n\r\nIf you discuss `t` in a blog post or podcast, [let me know][email] and I'll\r\nlink it here.\r\n\r\n[email]: mailto:sferik@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## Relationship Terminology\r\nThere is some ambiguity in the terminology used to describe relationships on\r\nTwitter. For example, some people use the term \"friends\" to mean everyone you\r\nfollow. In `t`, \"friends\" refers to just the subset of people who follow you\r\nback (i.e., friendship is bidirectional). Here is the full table of terminology\r\nused by `t`:\r\n\r\n                               ___________________________________________________\r\n                              |                         |                         |\r\n                              |     YOU FOLLOW THEM     |  YOU DON'T FOLLOW THEM  |\r\n     _________________________|_________________________|_________________________|_________________________\r\n    |                         |                         |                         |                         |\r\n    |     THEY FOLLOW YOU     |         friends         |        groupies         |        followers        |\r\n    |_________________________|_________________________|_________________________|_________________________|\r\n    |                         |                         |\r\n    |  THEY DON'T FOLLOW YOU  |         leaders         |\r\n    |_________________________|_________________________|\r\n                              |                         |\r\n                              |       followings        |\r\n                              |_________________________|\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Timeline](https://github.com/sferik/t/raw/master/screenshots/timeline.png)\r\n![List](https://github.com/sferik/t/raw/master/screenshots/list.png)\r\n\r\n## Shell completion\r\nIf you're running Zsh, you can source one of the [bundled completion\r\nfiles][completion] to get shell completion for `t` commands, subcommands, and\r\nflags.\r\n\r\nDon't run Zsh? Why not [contribute][] completion support for your favorite\r\nshell?\r\n\r\n[completion]: https://github.com/sferik/t/tree/master/etc\r\n[contribute]: https://github.com/sferik/t/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n## History\r\nThe [twitter gem][gem] previously contained a command-line interface, up until\r\nversion 0.5.0, when it was [removed][]. This project is offered as a sucessor\r\nto that effort, however it is a clean room implementation that contains none of\r\nthe original code.\r\n\r\n[gem]: https://rubygems.org/gems/twitter\r\n[removed]: https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter/commit/dd2445e3e2c97f38b28a3f32ea902536b3897adf\r\n![History](https://github.com/sferik/t/raw/master/screenshots/history.png)\r\n\r\n## Supported Ruby Versions\r\nThis library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby\r\nimplementations:\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.9.2\r\n* Ruby 1.9.3\r\n* Ruby 2.0.0\r\n\r\nIf something doesn't work on one of these Ruby versions, it's a bug.\r\n\r\nThis library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby\r\nimplementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIf you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may\r\nvolunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests\r\nrun and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your\r\nimplementation, you will be responsible for providing patches in a timely\r\nfashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time\r\nof a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\nIf you are running t on a remote computer you can use the flag --display-url during authorize process to display the url instead of opening the web browser.\r\n\r\n    t authorize --display-url\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright (c) 2011-2013 Erik Michaels-Ober.
