   Sounds good. Meeting Tuesday is fine.

   That's great news! Let's plan to chat around 8 AM tomorrow Pacific time. Does 
   that work for you?

   @sferik
   I asked Yehuda about the stipend. I believe it has already been sent. Glad 
   you're feeling better.

   @sferik
   Just checking in. How's everything going?

   @sferik
   Not sure about the payment. Feel free to ask Leah or Yehuda directly. Think 
   you'll be able to finish up your work on graphs this weekend?

   @sferik
   How are the graph enhancements coming?

   @sferik
   How are the graphs coming? I'm really looking forward to seeing what you do 
   with Raphaël.

   @sferik
   Awesome! Any luck duplicating the Gemfile.lock error with Ruby 1.9.2 final?

   @sferik
   I just committed a bunch of cleanup and fixes to RailsAdmin that touched many 
   of files. Make sure you pull to avoid conflicts.

   @sferik
   I'm trying to debug the issue you were having with the Bundler Gemfile.lock 
   shortref. What version of Ruby and RubyGems are you running?

   @hurrycane
   I'm trying to debug the issue you were having with the Bundler Gemfile.lock 
   shortref. What version of Ruby and RubyGems are you running?

   @hurrycane
   I just committed a bunch of cleanup and fixes to RailsAdmin that touched many 
   of files. Make sure you pull to avoid conflicts.

   @hurrycane
   Awesome! Any luck duplicating the Gemfile.lock error with Ruby 1.9.2 final?

   @hurrycane
   How are the graphs coming? I'm really looking forward to seeing what you do 
   with Raphaël.

   @hurrycane
   How are the graph enhancements coming?

   @hurrycane
   Not sure about the payment. Feel free to ask Leah or Yehuda directly. Think 
   you'll be able to finish up your work on graphs this weekend?

   @hurrycane
   Just checking in. How's everything going?

   @hurrycane
   I asked Yehuda about the stipend. I believe it has already been sent. Glad 
   you're feeling better.

   @hurrycane
   That's great news! Let's plan to chat around 8 AM tomorrow Pacific time. Does 
   that work for you?

   @hurrycane
   Sounds good. Meeting Tuesday is fine.
